# Motivation
Electricity demand forecasting is a topic that is within the interest of government and market bodies, with the consensus of accurate forecasts of energy demand driving profitability. Electricity in Australia is generated primarily using oil, coal, and gas as fuel[@BhattacharyaMita2020Coep]. Also, with oil prices increasing, this implies that the cost to generate energy will also increase[@KpodarKangni2022Tdio]. Therefore, profit maximization is achieved when energy production is minimized to be near actual energy demand. Thus, if electricity demand can be modelled accurately, government and market bodies can then utilize such information to tailor policies as well as optimize pricing. A recent phenomenon in the electricity grid has been the shift towards renewable energy sources such solar photovoltaic and wind generation. While these technologies are indeed cleaner they bring with them risks[@arenawebsite] due to their intermittency and inability to be dispatchable as compared to electricity produced from fossil fuels. As of 2021, renewables accounted for 23% of total electricity generation in the state of NSW[@energywebsite]. As it is non dispatchable, renewable electricity generation acts to lower the energy demand of the grid, so much so, that the Australian Energy Market Operation (AEMO) has already acknowledged that the increasing uptake in rooftop solar will shift maximum load demand to later in the day at sunset as temperatures remain high but roof top solar output falls to nil[@AEMOdemandwebsite]. The increase in renewable electricity generation will see a parallel requirement for flexible electricity generation such as gas, pumped hydro and grid scale batteries with quick ramp up ability to cope with the variability in supply[@AGLwebsite]. And with that, a more robust shorter term electricity demand forecasting process will be required to ensure that the quick start alternative electricity generators have sufficient warning to ramp up when required.

# Introduction
The aim of this paper is to investigate different modelling techniques to generate a rolling 60 min forward demand forecast for the state NSW electricity grid that could be used by flexible quick start generators (gas, pumped hydro, and grid scale batteries) to help minimise operational costs and give a competitive edge in pricing which will benefit its profitability and flow down to lower costs for the end users of the electricity grid.

Quick start electricity generators are essential to the electricity generation mix as they add flexibility to the grid to cope with highly variable demand [@AGLwebsite].  This flexibility ensures a sufficient balance of supply and demand as these quick start generators can supply with a shorter ramp up period. While the ramp up period is shorter than conventional base load generators, it still important for an electricity generator to be able to estimate how much electricity is required by the grid within a short forecast window so that it can strategically plan generation output to minimise its startup and shut down costs and maximise profit. Times of high load requirement in the grid inevitable lead to higher spot prices, so it is in the interests of an electricity supplier to be able to accurately forecast and capitalise on such situations, inline with its operational constraints (startup and shutdown times, maintenance requirements). While an electricity demand forecast is already generated by AEMO [@AEMOforecastwebsite] for participants in the grid, this analysis aims to investigate a forecasting model that will outperform AEMO's demand forecast, allowing a supplier to take advantage of potential misalignment in AEMO's forecast to actual load demand.

AEMO produces a short term forecast model in 30 minute intervals (the 'Half-hourly demand model') [@AEMOforecastwebsite], that uses features such as a categorical value for each half hour block of the day and month of the year, dummy variables for weekends and public holidays and transformations of half hourly temperature inclusive of interaction terms. This model uses a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularisation algorithm which is a regression analysis method that automatically performs feature selection by including a penalty term to the loss function which acts to shrink the non significant variable coefficients to zero.

Our models seek to build upon the AEMO 'Half-hourly demand model', to test if other meteorological data such as solar irradiance can capture the impact of household solar photovoltaic generation in the grid, and whether rainfall has an impact on indoor electricity consumption. Our investigation seeks to compare the performance various time series and machine learning models such as LASSO, Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forrest Regression with the aim of improving the short term electricity demand forecast with a slight increase in computational cost. Each of the models will then be further refined via training with simulated data. The final model will be selected after comparison of various generated models and features, specifically through consideration of feature selection, accuracy, and interpretability and performance relative to AEMO's forecast. 

# Literature review

Initial review of the literature on electricity demand forecasting pointed to a well understood relationship between temperature and electricity demand that has already been incorporated by the AEMO's forecasting procedures [@AEMOforecastwebsite]. This relationship has been widely explored with a specific focus on higher frequency time intervals. [@McCullochJames2020IEDa] showed a strong relationship when modelling Australian 5-minute electricity demand with intraday temperature using a Generalised Additive Model. This same research also indicated that sensitivity of demand to temperature was heavily dependent on the time of day with higher demand sensitivity during hours of high human activity. In [@ZhangGuoqiang2020ANMf ], their support vector machine (SVM) model found other meteorological features such as wind speed, relative humidity, precipitation and air pressure impacted electricity demand. Interestingly the behaviour of these variables on demand was non linear, which the authors hypothesised could be due to their impact on relative temperature (ie high wind can act to help cool on warmer days, but make it feel colder on cooler days). [@VuD.H.2015Avif] regression model for monthly electricity demand for the State of NSW showed that demand was "predominantly dependent on temperature, humidity and the number of rainy days". While the study was done on monthly electricity demand data, it points to a link in meteorological features impacting NSW electricity demand which may also transfer to more granular time periods. 
Other literature included additional features and characteristics of the data such as seasonality and cyclicality (from hourly to monthly) in the electricity demand time series. As described in [@AEMOforecastwebsite], AEMO's half hourly model includes categorical values for half hourly block of the day and month of the year, and include dummy variables for non work days. In [@ClementsA.E.2016Fdel] study on Queensland electricity demand, seasonality of demand including hour of the day, day of the week were identified as important features that needed to be factored into the modelling. One approach by [@JiangPing2020Ance] was to remove the seasonality as a prepossessing step through a Fast Fourier Transform method which converted the electricity demand from time series domain to frequency domain. In this model, the seasonality was removed so as not to affect the SVM algorithm. Other approaches such as [@AlonsoAndrésM.2020ASSL], chose to let their Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network to capture the seasonal idiosyncrasy naturally. The daily seasonality of hourly blocks was identified in the data exploration, so an LSTM with 24 hour time steps was used to capture the seasonality. As our paper sets out to investigate multiple forecasting techniques, the seasonality will need to be incorporated through different methods.
As the complexity of electricity demand has evolved so has the research into techniques for its forecasting. Earlier models explored Box and Jenkins time series modelling [@HaganMartinT.1987TTSA] or what is commonly known today as ARIMA. They found that a seasonal ARIMA model was well suited to electricity load forecasting where the forecast model was a linear combination of previous days electricity load with 24 hour (daily) and 168 hour (weekly) autoregressive lag included in their model. It was noted that including a transfer function to model the non linear relationship between temperature and electricity load should improve the forecasting error. A similar autoregressive approach in [VuD.H.2017Sedf] using NSW daily electricity demand data looked at grouping days of the week with similar electricity demand profiles together (weekends) in the modelling to improve the robustness of the forecast and to vary its coefficients with time to better capture the relationship to more recent data points.  
As previously discussed, AEMO's half hourly model is a linear regression technique that uses the LASSO regularisation algorithm to produce a forecast which aims to 'describe the relationship between underlying demand and key explanatory' [@AEMOforecastwebsite]. In this respect it is more of an explanatory model in contrast to the predictive ARIMA methods above that have no explanatory power. Multiple regression techniques have provided a simple, yet powerful approach to forecast short term electricity demand. In [@CharltonNathaniel2014Arpm] a study was performed on 20 different locations, with 24 linear regression models generated to forecast electricity demand for each hour of the day at each location, which included variables such as temperature (and polynomial transformation), dummy variables for season and weekday/weekend with good performance of 0.70 R2. In the Australian context, [@ShuFan2012SLFB] regression study on Victorian and South Australian electricity demand, produced a separate model (48) for each half-hourly period of the day, and included variables such as temperature (current and lagged, 24hr min and max), previous demand observations (24hr min, max and average) and calendar variables to forecast current electricity demand. A stepwise variable selection was carried out from a wider set of variables with a process of elimination and analysis of the effect on mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) used as the selection criterion. In [@2019Uiem], a linear regression forecasting model was used to predict 30min electricity pricing utilising the LASSO algorithm for its variable selection. This allowed an almost 'unlimited' number of variables to be used in the forecasting. In keeping with the approach by AEMO, we look to also implement a LASSO regularisation algorithm but our approach will investigate additional transformations and meteorological variables. 
While there was originally more focus on regression modelling of short term electricity demand, the research has shifted to techniques that can model the complex nonlinear relationship of electricity demand to temperature and seasonality. One of the most recent papers in the literature, [@9282124], forecasts 24 hour ahead electricity load for the city of Toronto by combining a LSTM network using historical electrical demand with a deep Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) using forecasted meteorological inputs (temperature). The combination of the two artificial neural networks outperformed each individual network as measured by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Another approach to model the non-linear relationships is forecasting with a Support Vector Regression (SVR) which uses a kernel to convert non-linear data to a high-dimensional space and then separates the data with a hyperplane. [@JiangPing2020Moed] utilised SVM algorithms with 30min time series electricity demand data to generate a forecast for both NSW and Singapore electricity demand, performing better than their benchmarking models. In [@LiRanran2021Mlss], a least squares support vector machine was used to model half hourly electricity demand for New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia which as a method is less computationally expensive than the standard SVM technique. For this model, the data was split between work days and weekends and a lagged time series was used with a radial basis function (RBF) kernel to model each half hour forecast. The authors did not include temperature, which we seek to utilise for our SVM analysis.
Finally, Random Forest regression models have also been used as a machine learning technique for short term electricity demand forecasting. They are a type of ensemble model that utilises classification and regression trees to apply bagging to generate a series or decision/regression trees that each vote on a result. One of the benefits of random forest models is they provide a feature importance metric that can be utilised for feature selection in high dimensions of data. In [@HuangNantian2016APIF], particular attention was paid to removing outliers as they could have a 'significant effect on the importance of the features'. The paper's analysis found that for 1 hour forward electricity demand forecast, the random forest model's most important features were the previous 24 hours of actual demand, whether it was a workday, and the day of the week. A more recent paper [@DudekGrzegorz2022ACSo] applied the random forest method to forecasting short term electricity demand but adding additional features for daily and weekly seasonality. Again, only calendar features were used in the modelling for both papers, with no temperature data utilised. While there has been the use of random forest techniques for short term electricity demand forecasting in the Australian context [@FanGuo-Feng2021Fsel], they have been used within combined hybrid machine learning models, so we believe our research into applying soley random forest regression model for short term forecasting is novel, which will also seek to use meteorological data.
Our paper seeks to build upon the success in the literature above by applying similar machine learning methods (with additional meteorological data) to generate a comparison of the techniques to identify the best performing model specific to the NSW grid. In [@WangZhe2021Pcde], it is apparent that the best model approach and subset of features are heavily dependent on characteristics of that grid, so while these machine learning methods above have been heavily researched, we seek to understand which one of them can outperform the AEMO demand forecast.
