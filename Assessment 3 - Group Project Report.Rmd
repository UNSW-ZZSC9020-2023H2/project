# Material and Methods

## Software

R and Python of course are great software for Data Science. Sometimes, you might want to use `bash` utilities such as `awk` or `sed`.

Of course, to ensure reproducibility, you should use something like `Git` and RMarkdown (or a Jupyter Notebook). Do **not** use Word!

## Description of the Data

How are the data stored? What are the sizes of the data files? How many files? etc.

## Pre-processing Steps

What did you have to do to transform the data so that they become useable?

## Data Cleaning

How did you deal with missing data? etc. 

## Assumptions

What assumptions are you making on the data?

## Modelling Methods

# Exploratory Data Analysis

# Analysis and Results

# Discussion

Put the results you got in the previous chapter in perspective with respect to the problem studied.

# Conclusion
