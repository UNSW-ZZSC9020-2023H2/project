# Motivation
Electricity demand forecasting is a topic that is within the interest of government and market bodies, with the consensus of accurate forecasts of energy demand driving profitability. Electricity in Australia is generated primarily using oil, coal, and gas as fuel[@BhattacharyaMita2020Coep]. Also, with oil prices increasing, this implies that the cost to generate energy will also increase[@KpodarKangni2022Tdio]. Therefore, profit maximization is achieved when energy production is minimized to be near actual energy demand. Thus, if electricity demand can be modelled accurately, government and market bodies can then utilize such information to tailor policies as well as optimize pricing. A recent phenomenon in the electricity grid has been the shift towards renewable energy sources such solar photovoltaic and wind generation. While these technologies are indeed cleaner they bring with them risks[@arenawebsite] due to their intermittency and inability to be dispatchable as compared to electricity produced from fossil fuels. As of 2021, renewables accounted for 23% of total electricity generation in the state of NSW[@energywebsite]. As it is non dispatchable, renewable electricity generation acts to lower the energy demand of the grid, so much so, that the Australian Energy Market Operation (AEMO) has already acknowledged that the increasing uptake in rooftop solar will shift maximum load demand to later in the day at sunset as temperatures remain high but roof top solar output falls to nil[@AEMOdemandwebsite]. The increase in renewable electricity generation will see a parallel requirement for flexible electricity generation such as gas, pumped hydro and grid scale batteries with quick ramp up ability to cope with the variability in supply[@AGLwebsite]. And with that, a more robust shorter term electricity demand forecasting process will be required to ensure that the quick start alternative electricity generators have sufficient warning to ramp up when required.

# Introduction
The aim of this paper is to investigate different modelling techniques to generate a rolling 60 min forward demand forecast for the state NSW electricity grid that could be used by flexible quick start generators (gas, pumped hydro, and grid scale batteries) to help minimise operational costs and give a competitive edge in pricing which will benefit its profitability and flow down to lower costs for the end users of the electricity grid.

Quick start electricity generators are essential to the electricity generation mix as they add flexibility to the grid to cope with highly variable demand [@AGLwebsite].  This flexibility ensures a sufficient balance of supply and demand as these quick start generators can supply with a shorter ramp up period. While the ramp up period is shorter than conventional base load generators, it still important for an electricity generator to be able to estimate how much electricity is required by the grid within a short forecast window so that it can strategically plan generation output to minimise its startup and shut down costs and maximise profit. Times of high load requirement in the grid inevitable lead to higher spot prices, so it is in the interests of an electricity supplier to be able to accurately forecast and capitalise on such situations, inline with its operational constraints (startup and shutdown times, maintenance requirements). While an electricity demand forecast is already generated by AEMO [@AEMOforecastwebsite] for participants in the grid, this analysis aims to investigate a forecasting model that will outperform AEMO's demand forecast, allowing a supplier to take advantage of potential misalignment in AEMO's forecast to actual load demand.

AEMO produces a short term forecast model in 30 minute intervals (the 'Half-hourly demand model') [@AEMOforecastwebsite], that uses features such as a categorical value for each half hour block of the day and month of the year, dummy variables for weekends and public holidays and transformations of half hourly temperature inclusive of interaction terms. This model uses a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularisation algorithm which is a regression analysis method that automatically performs feature selection by including a penalty term to the loss function which acts to shrink the non significant variable coefficients to zero.

Our models seek to build upon the AEMO 'Half-hourly demand model', to test if other meteorological data such as solar irradiance can capture the impact of household solar photovoltaic generation in the grid, and whether rainfall has an impact on indoor electricity consumption. Our investigation seeks to compare the performance various time series and machine learning models such as LASSO, Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Random Forrest Regression with the aim of improving the short term electricity demand forecast with a slight increase in computational cost. Each of the models will then be further refined via training with simulated data. The final model will be selected after comparison of various generated models and features, specifically through consideration of feature selection, accuracy, and interpretability and performance relative to AEMO's forecast.

R and Python of course are great software for Data Science. Sometimes, you might want to use `bash` utilities such as `awk` or `sed`.

Of course, to ensure reproducibility, you should use something like `Git` and RMarkdown (or a Jupyter Notebook). Do **not** use Word!
