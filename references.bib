abstract = {.Analyse the dynamics of energy productivity for Australian states and territories..Australian states and territories converge to two energy productivity clubs..New South Wales and Victoria will be the forerunners in maintaining higher energy productivity in 2030.
The Australian government has recently launched a National Energy Productivity Plan that calls for a 40% increase in energy productivity (economic output divided by energy use) before 2030. Improving energy productivity would help boost economic competitiveness, reduce energy costs, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Australia. Understanding energy productivity dynamics at the state level is essential for the success of this program. This research analyses the convergence path of energy productivity in Australian states and territories. Club convergence analysis applied to data over the period 1990-2015 reveals two converging energy productivity clubs. Initial energy productivity, industry structure, and automobile fuel prices are important determinants of higher energy productivity. Based on Australian state energy productivity forecasts to 2030, New South Wales and Victoria will be the forerunners in maintaining higher energy productivity in 2030. Australia will not achieve a 40% increase in energy productivity before 2030 without significant changes to its fuel mix and industry structure.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the response of consumer price inflation to changes in domestic fuel prices, looking at the different categories of the overall consumer price index (CPI). We then combine household survey data with the CPI components to construct a CPI index for the poorest and richest income quintiles with the view to assess the distributional impact of the pass-through. To undertake this analysis, the paper provides an update to the Global Monthly Retail Fuel Price Database, expanding the product coverage to premium and regular fuels, the time dimension to December 2020, and the sample to 190 countries. Three key findings stand out. First, the response of inflation to gasoline price shocks is smaller, but more persistent and broad-based in developing economies than in advanced economies. Second, we show that past studies using crude oil prices instead of retail fuel prices to estimate the pass-through to inflation significantly underestimate it. Third, while the purchasing power of all households declines as fuel prices increase, the distributional impact is progressive. But the progressivity phases out within 6 months after the shock in advanced economies, whereas it persists beyond a year in developing countries.
