abstract = {.Analyse the dynamics of energy productivity for Australian states and territories..Australian states and territories converge to two energy productivity clubs..New South Wales and Victoria will be the forerunners in maintaining higher energy productivity in 2030.
The Australian government has recently launched a National Energy Productivity Plan that calls for a 40% increase in energy productivity (economic output divided by energy use) before 2030. Improving energy productivity would help boost economic competitiveness, reduce energy costs, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions in Australia. Understanding energy productivity dynamics at the state level is essential for the success of this program. This research analyses the convergence path of energy productivity in Australian states and territories. Club convergence analysis applied to data over the period 1990-2015 reveals two converging energy productivity clubs. Initial energy productivity, industry structure, and automobile fuel prices are important determinants of higher energy productivity. Based on Australian state energy productivity forecasts to 2030, New South Wales and Victoria will be the forerunners in maintaining higher energy productivity in 2030. Australia will not achieve a 40% increase in energy productivity before 2030 without significant changes to its fuel mix and industry structure.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the response of consumer price inflation to changes in domestic fuel prices, looking at the different categories of the overall consumer price index (CPI). We then combine household survey data with the CPI components to construct a CPI index for the poorest and richest income quintiles with the view to assess the distributional impact of the pass-through. To undertake this analysis, the paper provides an update to the Global Monthly Retail Fuel Price Database, expanding the product coverage to premium and regular fuels, the time dimension to December 2020, and the sample to 190 countries. Three key findings stand out. First, the response of inflation to gasoline price shocks is smaller, but more persistent and broad-based in developing economies than in advanced economies. Second, we show that past studies using crude oil prices instead of retail fuel prices to estimate the pass-through to inflation significantly underestimate it. Third, while the purchasing power of all households declines as fuel prices increase, the distributional impact is progressive. But the progressivity phases out within 6 months after the shock in advanced economies, whereas it persists beyond a year in developing countries.

Using the Generalised Additive Model (GAM) framework we link high frequency (5-minute) aggregate electricity demand in Australia to the time of the day, time of the year and intra-day temperature. We document a strong relationship between high frequency electricity demand and intra-day temperature. We show a superior model fit when using Daylight Saving Time (DST), or clock time, instead of the standard (solar) time. We introduce the time weighted temperature model that captures instantaneous electricity demand sensitivity to temperature as a function of the human daily activity cycle, by assigning different temperature signal weighting based on the DST time. The results on DST and time weighted temperature modelling are novel in the literature and are important innovations in high frequency electricity demand forecasting.},

Selection of appropriate climatic variables for prediction of electricity demand is critical as it affects the accuracy of the prediction. Different climatic variables may have different impacts on the electricity demand due to the varying geographical conditions. This paper uses multicollinearity and backward elimination processes to select the most appropriate variables and develop a multiple regression model for monthly forecasting of electricity demand. The former process is employed to reduce the collinearity between the explanatory variables by excluding the predictor which has highly linear relationship with the other independent variables in the dataset. In the next step, involving backward elimination regression analysis, the variables with coefficients that have a low level of significance are removed. A case study has been reported in this paper by acquiring the data from the state of New South Wales, Australia. The data analyses have revealed that the climatic variables such as temperature, humidity, and rainy days predominantly affect the electricity demand of the state of New South Wales. A regression model for monthly forecasting of the electricity demand is developed using the climatic variables that are dominant. The model has been trained and validated using the time series data. The monthly forecasted demands obtained using the proposed model are found to be closely matched with the actual electricity demands highlighting the fact that the prediction errors are well within the acceptable limits.},

Reliable forecast of electricity can encourage accessible and responsible information for scholars, policymakers, end-consumers and managers of the electricity market. Numerous electricity forecasting methods have been achieved commendably, the performance of which varies depending on numerical characteristics and operational conditions. In this study, the composite forecasting concept is introduced and implemented to show the potential of forecasting performance. This modeling concept is a remarkable ability to identify and measure any seasonal relationship that exists in electricity demand data. Moreover, it is available as a toolbox in many of the programming operation research. In the module of nonlinear time series decomposition, the noise disturbance is initially considered before extracting the seasonal variation to support the condition that the linear and stationary time series should be used for the seasonality identifying method. Also, we further provide a new insight of prediction intervals estimation to better reflect the uncertainties of the underlying challenging power system plan and operation. The results show that the proposed model can generate promising forecasts compared to the other combination schemata and it can be useful for both policy-makers and public agencies to guarantee the security and regulation of the power system.},

The quality of short-term electricity load forecasting is crucial to the operation and trading activities of market participants in an electricity market. In this paper, it is shown that a multiple equation time-series model, which is estimated by repeated application of ordinary least squares, has the potential to match or even outperform more complex nonlinear and nonparametric forecasting models. The key ingredient of the success of this simple model is the effective use of lagged information by allowing for interaction between seasonal patterns and intra-day dependencies. Although the model is built using data for the Queensland region of Australia, the method is completely generic and applicable to any load forecasting problem. The model’s forecasting ability is assessed by means of the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). For day-ahead forecast, the MAPE returned by the model over a period of 11 years is an impressive 1.36%. The forecast accuracy of the model is compared with a number of benchmarks including three popular alternatives and one industrial standard reported by the Australia Energy Market Operator (AEMO). The performance of the model developed in this paper is superior to all benchmarks and outperforms the AEMO forecasts by about a third in terms of the MAPE criterion.},

In particular, smart meters allow tracking electricity load consumption at a very disaggregated level and at high frequency rates. This data opens the possibility of developing new forecasting models with a potential positive impact on electricity systems. We present a general methodology that can process and forecast many smart-meter time series. Instead of using traditional and univariate approaches, we develop a single but complex recurrent neural-network model with long short-term memory that can capture individual consumption patterns and consumptions from different households. The resulting model can accurately predict future loads (short-term) of individual consumers, even if these were not included in the original training set. This entails a great potential for large-scale applications as once the single network is trained, accurate individual forecast for new consumers can be obtained at almost no computational cost. The proposed model is tested under a large set of numerical experiments by using a real-world dataset with thousands of disaggregated electricity consumption time series. Furthermore, we explore how geo-demographic segmentation of consumers may impact the forecasting accuracy of the model.},

This paper presents the development of an autoregressive based time varying (ARTV) model to forecast electricity demand in a short-term period. The ARTV model is developed based on an autoregressive model by allowing its coefficients to be updated at pre-set time intervals. The updated coefficients help to enhance the relationships between electricity demand and its own historical values, and accordingly improve the performance of the model. In addition, a representative data adjustment procedure including a similar-day-replacement technique and a data-shifting algorithm is proposed in this paper to cultivate the historical demand data. These techniques help cleanse the raw data by mitigating the abnormal data points when daylight saving and holiday occur. Consequently, the robustness of the model is significantly enhanced, and accordingly the overall forecasting accuracy of the model is considerably improved. A case study has been reported in this paper by acquiring the relevant data for the state of New South Wales, Australia. The results show that the proposed model outperforms conventional seasonal autoregressive and neural network models in short term electricity demand forecasting.},

abstract = {Short-term load forecasting is an essential instrument in power system planning, operation, and control. Many operating decisions are based on load forecasts, such as dispatch scheduling of generating capacity, reliability analysis, and maintenance planning for the generators. Overestimation of electricity demand will cause a conservative operation, which leads to the start-up of too many units or excessive energy purchase, thereby supplying an unnecessary level of reserve. On the other hand, underestimation may result in a risky operation, with insufficient preparation of spinning reserve, causing the system to operate in a vulnerable region to the disturbance. In this paper, semi-parametric additive models are proposed to estimate the relationships between demand and the driver variables. Specifically, the inputs for these models are calendar variables, lagged actual demand observations, and historical and forecast temperature traces for one or more sites in the target power system. In addition to point forecasts, prediction intervals are also estimated using a modified bootstrap method suitable for the complex seasonality seen in electricity demand data. The proposed methodology has been used to forecast the half-hourly electricity demand for up to seven days ahead for power systems in the Australian National Electricity Market. The performance of the methodology is validated via out-of-sample experiments with real data from the power system, as well as through on-site implementation by the system operator.},

However, the real-time scheduling of electricity generation needs accurate modeling of electricity demand forecasting for a range of lead times. In order to better capture the nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics and the seasonal cycles of future electricity demand data, a new concept of the integrated model is developed and successfully applied to research the forecast of electricity demand in this paper. The proposed model combines adaptive Fourier decomposition method, a new signal preprocessing technology, for extracting useful element from the original electricity demand series through filtering the noise factors. Considering the seasonal term existing in the decomposed series, it should be eliminated through the seasonal adjustment method, in which the seasonal indexes are calculated and should multiply the forecasts back to restore the final forecast. Besides, a newly proposed moth-flame optimization algorithm is used to ensure the suitable parameters of the least square support vector machine which can generate the forecasts. Finally, the case studies of Australia demonstrated the efficacy and feasibility of the proposed integrated model. Simultaneously, it can provide a better concept of modeling for electricity demand prediction over different forecasting horizons.},

In this paper, a novel modeling framework was proposed for forecasting electricity demand. Sample entropy was developed to identify the nonlinearity and uncertainty in the original time series, after that redundant noise was removed through a decomposition technique. Besides, the most optimal modes of original series and the optimal input form of the model were determined by the feature selection method. Finally, electricity demand series can be conducted forecasting through least squares support vector machine tuned by multi-objective sine cosine optimization algorithm. The case studies of Australia demonstrated that the proposed framework can ensure high accuracy and strong stability. Thus, it can be considered as a useful tool for electricity demand forecasting.},

Then, an improved sequential backward search method was used to select the optimal forecasting feature subset based on the PI value of each feature. Finally, the optimal forecasting feature subset was used to train a new RF model as the final prediction model. Experiments showed that the prediction accuracy of RF trained by the optimal forecasting feature subset was higher than that of the original model and comparative models based on support vector regression and artificial neural network.},

abstract = {This paper develops a novel short-term load forecasting model that hybridizes several machine learning methods, such as support vector regression (SVR), grey catastrophe (GC (1,1)), and random forest (RF) modeling. The modeling process is based on the minimization of both SVR and risk. GC is used to process and extract catastrophe points in the long term to reduce randomness. RF is used to optimize forecasting performance by exploiting its superior optimization capability. The proposed SVR-GC-RF model has higher forecasting accuracy (MAPE values are 6.35% and 6.21%, respectively) using electric loads from Australian-Energy-Market-Operator; it can provide analytical support to forecast electricity consumption accurately.
•This paper hybridizes grey catastrophe and random forest with support vector regression for short-term load forecasting.•The proposed model overcomes the drawbacks, including singleness, randomness, low accuracy, and overfitting.•Experimental results reveal that the proposed model has greater forecasting accuracy than three alternative models.},

abstract = {•We studied how city electricity use is influenced by weather and COVID-19 pandemic.•Seven data-driven models were applied and evaluated for data of three cities.•Gradient boosting tree model delivers the most accurate prediction with CVRMSE of 4%−6%.•1 °C increase of ambient temperature drives up the three cities electricity usage by around 5%.•COVID-19 curtailment reduced city-scale electricity usage by 2%−12%.
Accurate electricity demand forecasts that account for impacts of extreme weather events are needed to inform electric grid operation and utility resource planning, as well as to enhance energy security and grid resilience. Three common data-driven models are used to predict city-scale daily electricity usage: linear regression models, machine learning models for time series data, and machine learning models for tabular data. In this study, we developed and compared seven data-driven models: (1) five-parameter change-point model, (2) Heating/Cooling Degree Hour model, (3) time series decomposed model implemented by Facebook Prophet, (4) Gradient Boosting Machine implemented by Microsoft lightGBM, and (5) three widely-used machine learning models (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network). Seven models are applied to the city-scale electricity usage data for three metropolitan areas in the United States: Sacramento, Los Angeles, and New York. Results show seven models can predict the metropolitan area's daily electricity use, with a coefficient of variation of the root mean square error (CVRMSE) less than 10%. The lightGBM provides the most accurate results, with CVRMSE on the test dataset of 6.5% for Los Angeles, 4.6% for Sacramento, and 4.1% for the New York metropolitan area. These models are further applied to explore how extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves) and unexpected public health events (e.g., COVID-19 pandemic) influence each city's electricity demand. Results show weather-sensitive component accounts for 30%–50% of the total daily electricity usage. Every degree Celsius ambient temperature increase in summer leads to about 5% (4.7% in Los Angeles, 6.2% in Sacramento, and 5.1% in New York) more daily electricity usage compared with the base load in the three metropolitan areas. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced city-scale electricity demand: compared with the pre-pandemic same months in 2019, daily electricity usage during the 2020 pandemic decreased by 10% in April and started to rebound in summer.},

abstract = {Mining temporal data for information is often inhibited by a multitude of formats: regular or irregular time intervals, point events that need aggregating, multiple observational units or repeated measurements on multiple individuals, and heterogeneous data types. This work presents a cohesive and conceptual framework for organizing and manipulating temporal data, which in turn flows into visualization, modeling, and forecasting routines. Tidy data principles are extended to temporal data by: (1) mapping the semantics of a dataset into its physical layout; (2) including an explicitly declared "index" variable representing time; (3) incorporating a "key" comprising single or multiple variables to uniquely identify units over time. This tidy data representation most naturally supports thinking of operations on the data as building blocks, forming part of a "data pipeline" in time-based contexts. A sound data pipeline facilitates a fluent workflow for analyzing temporal data. The infrastructure of tidy temporal data has been implemented in the R package, called tsibble.

abstract = {High-frequency water quality monitoring systems provide valuable measurements for predicting the trend of water quality, warning of abnormal activities or operating hydrological models. However, missing values are prevalent due to network miscommunication, device replacement or failure. Applying datasets with missing values can lead to biased results in statistical analysis or hydrological modelling work. We develop a cloud-based data processing system combining advanced algorithms to impute monitoring data in near real-time. The system provides high compatibility for supporting different water quality variables, imputation algorithms and extensive scalability to support numerous data streams. Based on the proposed approach, we review various imputation methods which can be applied to water quality data. Overall, this work provides a systematic design of a water quality data imputation system, explores the advantages and limitations of selected data imputation methods and analyses the imputation performance of two real-time water quality monitoring systems located in both the USA and Australia. The results provide practical guidelines for data imputation applications in water quality data.

abstract = {Machine learning has been the corner stone in analysing and extracting information from data and often a problem of missing values is encountered. Missing values occur because of various factors like missing completely at random, missing at random or missing not at random. All these may result from system malfunction during data collection or human error during data pre-processing. Nevertheless, it is important to deal with missing values before analysing data since ignoring or omitting missing values may result in biased or misinformed analysis. In literature there have been several proposals for handling missing values. In this paper, we aggregate some of the literature on missing data particularly focusing on machine learning techniques. We also give insight on how the machine learning approaches work by highlighting the key features of missing values imputation techniques, how they perform, their limitations and the kind of data they are most suitable for. We propose and evaluate two methods, the k nearest neighbor and an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on the random forest algorithm. Evaluation is performed on the Iris and novel power plant fan data with induced missing values at missingness rate of 5\% to 20\%. We show that both missForest and the k nearest neighbor can successfully handle missing values and offer some possible future research direction.},

abstract = {Some climate datasets are incomplete at certain places and times. A novel technique called the point estimation model of Biased Sentinel Hospitals-based Area Disease Estimation (P-BSHADE) is introduced to interpolate missing data in temperature datasets. Effectiveness of the technique was empirically evaluated in terms of an annual temperature dataset from 1950 to 2000 in China. The P-BSHADE technique uses a weighted summation of observed stations to derive unbiased and minimum error variance estimates of missing data. Both the ratio and covariance between stations were used in calculation of these weights. In this way, interpolation of missing data in the temperature dataset was improved, and best linear unbiased estimates (BLUE) were obtained. Using the same dataset, performance of P-BSHADE was compared against three estimators: kriging, inverse distance weighting (IDW), and spatial regression test (SRT). Kriging and IDW assume a homogeneous stochastic field, which may not be the case. SRT employs spatiotemporal data and has the potential to consider temperature nonhomogeneity caused by topographic differences, but has no objective function for the BLUE. Instead, P-BSHADE takes into account geographic spatial autocorrelation and nonhomogeneity, and maximizes an objective function for the BLUE of the target station. In addition to the theoretical advantages of P-BSHADE over the three other methods, case studies for an annual Chinese temperature dataset demonstrate its empirical superiority, except for the SRT from 1950 to 1970.},

abstract = {The main objective of this study is to determine and analyze cold and warm air temperature spells in the last 6 years (2007–2012) and reveal their impact on electrical energy consumption in a small-sized city such as Sombor (Serbia) with less than 50,000 inhabitants. Hourly air temperature values and electrical energy consumption data have been used as database for all methods. Warm and cold temperature spells (during heat and cold waves) have had the increasing tendencies in the last 6 years and they reflect on additional electrical energy consumption. Detailed analysis showed that higher energy demands occur during workdays and daytime period. Monitoring of the amount of consumed energy showed a clear relationship during the winter cold temperature spells, when electrical energy demand was higher than 0.3 MW. In summer period, the relationship was weaker and consumption was higher than 0.15 MW only when temperature exceeded 30 °C. A small number of air condition devices in houses and companies and mainly one-store buildings with thick walls, which make a good insulation from the outside air temperatures, are probably the main reasons for the above-mentioned results in summer. This paper introduces a new method to resolve the problem of short-term load forecasting, based on the support vector machines (SVM) technology and particle swarm optimization that has been used to optimize the SVM parameters. Similar-day-based forecast has shown that similar days for training should be filtered also using classifier of temperature period (cooling degree-days or heating degree-days in a row). Forecasting error is smaller compared to solutions where similar days are found only on season and temperature.},

We find that for each additional day in which the mean temperature exceeds 32 °C, relative to a day in which temperature is in the range 10 °C–16 °C, there is an 8.9\% increase in annual electricity consumption. Exploiting rich information on the use of major home appliances which is available in CRECS, we demonstrate that this large effect is due to households using air conditioners more, at both the extensive and intensive margins, to cope with heat stress. Combining our baseline estimates with daily temperature projections from eight recent climate models, we simulate changes in future electricity consumption due to global warming. We find that residential electricity consumption would increase by 9.59–30.09\% in the medium term and by 9.77–47.70\% in the long term, depending on whether measures are taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions.

abstract = {Risks from weather and climate extremes to governments, industries and communities are increasing and, at present, are not well quantified. In the presence of climate variability and long-term change, it may not be appropriate to base an assessment of the likelihood of climate hazards on the long-term averages. Many weather and climate extremes have increased in frequency and/or intensity in recent decades with climate model projections showing that several trends are likely to continue. The analysis of historical records is complementary to the use of climate models in understanding the changing nature of extremes.
In this study, we apply a consistent methodology to examine the modulation in the probability of extremes in temperature and rainfall as they are influenced by climate change over the past century and natural climate variability and present summary tables and charts for a comprehensive comparison. The daily temperature data – maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) air temperature – are from a ‘high-quality’ dataset developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology – the Australian Climate Observations Reference Network (ACORN) Surface Air Temperature (SAT) dataset. In the absence of a comparable dataset for daily rainfall, we analysed rainfall data at ACORN-SAT locations. Our analyses of extremes are based on annual maxima (annual minima for Tmin) of daily time series from 58 Australian sites over the period 1910–2009.
We found statistically significant long-term increases in extreme maximum temperatures but with marked regional and seasonal variations. The increase in the lowest minimum temperature extremes typically exceeds the increase in the extremes of maximum temperature. Daily precipitation extremes rarely exhibit long-term change over the century but are strongly modulated by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The relative importance of long-term change and climate variability therefore depends on the variable or index.
We conclude that in assessing the likelihood of climate hazards, one needs to consider the modulation of climate extremes due to both long-term change and climate variability. Our findings imply that when planning for adaptation, different emphasis needs to be given to changing temperature and precipitation extremes.},
